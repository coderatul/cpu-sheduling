## First Come First Serve (FCFS)

- **Overview**: A non-preemptive algorithm executing processes in arrival order.
- **Features**: Handles duplicate arrival times and detects halts effectively.

### Usage

```python
prcs = ["P1", "P2", "P3", "P4", "P5", "P6"]
at = [4, 19, 2, 3, 2, 2]
bt = [1, 2, 7, 1, 2, 2]
s1 = CpuSheduling(prcs, at, bt)
s1.fcfs()
```

### Output
- Displays execution order, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time in a tabular format.

## Future Development
> Planned implementations include **SJF**, **SRTF**, and **RR** algorithms.

## Contributions
